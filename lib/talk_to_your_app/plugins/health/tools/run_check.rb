        # Runs one registered health check by name and reports pass/fail plus
        # whatever value the check produced.
        #
        # Two failure modes, handled differently:
        #
        # 1. The check raises, or times out. Treated as a failed check (not a
        #    500) — surfaced as `passed: false` with an error, never propagated,
        #    the same posture the DB/Flipper plugins take toward backend errors.
        #    Also logged server-side (warn level) so it shows up in ops
        #    monitoring even though the MCP response stays a graceful failure —
        #    a raising check is exactly the kind of thing an operator watching
        #    logs wants to know about, and the audit logger's `outcome` field
        #    alone wouldn't flag it (this tool never returns an `error()`
        #    response for a raising check, by design, so `AuditLogger` sees a
        #    normal `success`).
        # 2. The check returns something other than the documented
        #    `bool | [bool, value]` contract. Rejected outright as a tool error
        #    rather than guessed at — coercing e.g. `0` or `nil` into a pass/fail
        #    via Ruby truthiness would silently misreport the very thing this
        #    tool exists to report accurately (see #normalize).

          # Distinct from StandardError so the outer rescue can tell "the check
          # took too long" apart from "the check raised" without inspecting
          # Timeout::Error's message (which #call's timeout: keyword would
          # otherwise collide with, since Timeout.timeout raises the class
          # passed as its second argument, not the built-in Timeout::Error, to
          # keep an operator's own `rescue Timeout::Error` inside a check from
          # swallowing ours).
          #
          # Two known limits of this timeout, neither fixable from here:
          #
          # 1. Timeout.timeout works by Thread#raise-ing into the block's
          #    thread at the next point Ruby bytecode runs. A thread blocked
          #    inside a C extension (a stuck low-level socket read in some HTTP
          #    client, a blocking DB driver call, a stalled DNS resolution) does
          #    not yield control back to the interpreter until the underlying
          #    syscall returns, so HealthCheckTimeout can't fire until then —
          #    the very "ping a third-party API" case this README leads with is
          #    exactly the case most likely to block in native code. This is a
          #    stdlib limitation, not a bug in this plugin: timeout: here is a
          #    best-effort Ruby-level backstop, not a hard kill. Prefer a
          #    library-native timeout (most HTTP clients accept one) inside the
          #    check itself when the dependency supports it.
          # 2. Because Thread#raise delivers wherever the check's code currently
          #    is — including inside the operator's OWN begin/rescue — a check
          #    written as `begin; ThirdParty.ping!; rescue StandardError; false;
          #    end` will catch HealthCheckTimeout in its own rescue before it
          #    reaches here, reporting an ordinary `passed: false` with no
          #    "timed out" message rather than propagating. Being distinct from
          #    Timeout::Error only helps against a `rescue Timeout::Error`
          #    inside the check; it does nothing against a broad `rescue
          #    StandardError` or bare `rescue`. Operators should avoid swallowing
          #    StandardError inside a health check block for this reason.

          # other shape is guessed at. Ruby's truthiness (only nil/false are
          # falsy) makes silent coercion dangerous here: a check that
          # accidentally returns `0` (e.g. a bare `recent.count`, a very
          # plausible slip given the README's own `[cond, recent.count]`
          # pattern) would coerce to `passed: true` even though zero recent
          # items plausibly means "nothing ran". A check whose last expression
          # accidentally evaluates to `nil` would coerce to `passed: false`,
          # masking an authoring bug as a real outage. Returns `[passed, value]`
          # on a valid shape, or a String error message on an invalid one —
